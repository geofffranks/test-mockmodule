v0.171.0
- allow chaining of new with mock, redefine, define
- redefine() no longer triggers errors if the object being mocked is not a hashref
- Adds a define() method for mocking new functions that do not exist. Throws an
  error if a function does exist.

  the usage of define/redefine if desired.:
  ```
  use Test::MockModule qw/strict/;
  ```

  been installed/loaded

v0.16
    - Fixes an issue where warnings were thrown for mismatched prototypes,
      when mocking a prototyped function.

      Thanks @toddr for the fix!

v0.15
    - Fixes a minor bug in the release tarball

v0.14
    - Fixes a bug where the `redefine()` function was dying when attempting to
      mock a function that was defined further up a module's inheritance chain.
      It now only dies when the mocked function does not exist in the module being
      mocked, or any of its parent modules. Thanks @atoomic for the improvement!

v0.13
    - Added the `redefine()` function. It works just like `mock()`, except if the
      method being mocked doesn't exist, it causes a panic. Many thanks to Felipe
      Gasper for this feature!

v0.12
    - Added the `noop()` function to make mocking noops easier. Thanks for the PR,
      Ali Zia!

v0.11 2016-10-27
    - Various housekeeping, testing and minor fixes, courtesy of Paul Cochrane, thanks!

v0.10 2015-05-30
    - Updated docs for mocking when using exported functions

v0.09 2015-03-15
    - Ensure LICENSE autogenerates for distribution, fixed license issues in Build.PL

v0.08 2015-03-14
    - Updated README with correct instructions now that we use Build.PL

v0.07 2015-03-14
    - Updated docs for more clarity when handling objects of mocked classes.

v0.06 2015-03-07
    - unmock() on inherited subroutines will dispatch to the parent module,
      rather than replace the local subroutine with the parent's subroutine
      from the time of mocking (RT77439)

v0.05 2004-03-24
    - unmock() accepts a list of subroutines to unmock. Thanks to David Wheeler
      for the suggestion and patch
    - Added t/pod_coverage.t

v0.04  2004-12-12
    - You can now mock a subroutine with a scalar value or a reference
      (install sub that returns the value). Thanks to Ovid for the suggestion.

v0.03  2004-12-05
    - Restores subs/methods that previously didn't exist (undefine them)

v0.02  2004-11-28
    - Fixed restoring inherited methods

v0.01  2004-11-28
